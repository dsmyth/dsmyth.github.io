Trying to teach myself a little Python, decided to tinker a bit with GeoJSON.

Whipped up a quick script that read data from the Seattle City Health Inspector results 
database & spurts out a GeoJSON file that show inspected restaurants with the latest inspection results.

Those with a "satisfactory" result are coded green. Those with an "unsatisfactory" result are coded red. Otherwise, they are grey.
